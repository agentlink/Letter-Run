English Language Dictionary
================================

[GitHub link](https://github.com/adambom/dictionary)

This repository houses the contents of Webster's Unabridged English Dictionary.

The dictionary can be found in plain text form [here](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29765)

You'll also find some julia files that were used to parse the text and organize it into the nice
json you see here.

# Contents
- dictionary.json: This is the raw data scraped from the dictionary. Unsurprisingly, it's in the format
of a dictionary, i.e. ```{ "Word": "Definition" }```
- graph.json: This is a graph representation of the dictionary. Each word is paired with a list of the
words that define it
- dictionary.txt: This is the plain text file (I converted it from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8)
- main.jl: The julia script that parses the data
- _.jl: My in-progress implementation of underscore in julia

# How to run
If you want to run the code yourself, I would recommend downloading [Julia Studio](http://forio.com/julia),
which is and IDE for Julia. It comes with the binaries pre-installed. You can also get the binaries or build
from source from [julialang.org](http://julialang.org).
